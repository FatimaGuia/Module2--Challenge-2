    <div class="about">
        <ul><p>My name is Fatima Guia and I am currently a Computer Science major and hopefully becoming a software engineer in the future.
            I am currently attending Hillsborough Community College and am hoping to transfer to the University of Central Florida. 
            I have big dreams and even if sometimes it gets difficult, i try and look at the bright side of the situation.
            I love hanging out with my family and spending uality time with them, they are eveything to me and are what keep me motivated at the end of the day.  
        </ul> </p>
            <ul><p>A few cool facts about me is that I am a certified black belt in Taekwondo and won a few trophies in Karate competition.
             I am also a huge fan of f√∫tbol/soccer, i have played in highschool and absoulutely fell in love with it.
              Also, as a person who has only beeen coding for a few months, i am intrigued by the coding world and the coding community and have always been wanting to start coding.
               I am a quick learner and is a person who always finds a way to find a solution to a problem.
               I love growing my skills and findig new ways and methods through collaborations with my peers.
            </ul></p>
