<p align="left"> My name is Fatima Guia, and my goal in the future is to be able to land a position at a tech company, and to hopefully in the near future obtain an internship as well! I am always ready to learn new things not only through what i learn in class but also through my peers!</p>

<p align="left">~ Planning out and making a portfolio not only helps to display my work but also to hopefully get some feedback and learn new methods and ways to code!</p>

<p align="left">~ In the process of making my portfolio, my goal was to display my css and html abilites and to also keep in mind screen readers to make my code a lot more accessible, by using what we learned in class from our lectures so far in the bootcamp!</p> 

<p align="left">~ The purpose of this portfolio was to be able to demonstrate my css and html abilites from what i learned in this weeks lectures!   </p>
